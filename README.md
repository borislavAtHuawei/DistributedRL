 1. [Parametric Return Density Estimation for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3497)
 The paper Marc et al. are building upon. Studies quantile learning and quantile based control. Also uses cliff walking example.
 2. [
A Distributional Perspective on Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887)
Incomplete ideas, which are completed in the next paper.Crutchy realization with projection step to remedy disjoint support problem.
 3. [Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Quantile Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10044) 
 Main results. Complete theory and implmentation.
 4. [Deep Exploration via Bootstrapped DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04621)
 NIPS paper which is somewhat close to Marc et al ideas. Basically keeps several copie of Q net and switches between them in each episode. Main selling point is exploration.
 5. [ Approximately optimal approximate reinforcement learning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./jcl/papers/aoarl/Final.pdf) 
Paper mentioned in Marc et al. They think this direction is worth exploring, haven't checked yet.
